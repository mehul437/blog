            explanation:'Buddhism is the second oldest religion in Indonesia after Hinduism, which arrived from India around the second century.[10] The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to the history of Hinduism, as a number of empires influenced by Indian culture were established around the same period. The oldest Buddhist archaeological site in Indonesia is arguably the Batujaya stupas complex in Karawang, West Java. The oldest relic in Batujaya was estimated to originate from the 2nd century, while the latest dated from the 12th century. Subsequently, significant numbers of Buddhist sites were found in Jambi, Palembang and Riau provinces in Sumatra, as well as in Central and East Java. The Indonesian archipelago has, over the centuries, witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires, such as the Sailendra dynasty, the Mataram and Srivijaya empires.'

            explanation: 'The name "Joshua tree" is commonly said to have been given by a group of Mormon settlers crossing the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century: The tree role in guiding them through the desert combined with its unique shape reminded them of a biblical story in which Joshua keeps his hands reached out for an extended period of time to enable the Israelites in their conquest of Canaan(Joshua, Further) shaggy leaves may have provided the appearance of a beard. However, no direct or contemporary attestation of this origin exists, and the name Joshua tree is not recorded until after Mormon contact; moreover, the physical appearance of the Joshua tree more closely resembles a similar story told of Moses.'

Well, it can lead to various health issues like high blood pressure, stroke or even heart diseases. It is for this reason that one should not have too much salt in their food. Salt, which is also known as sodium chloride is used in various food preparations to enhance the taste and is a stabilizer. It is also used as a preservative, as bacteria cannot thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The mineral present in salt - sodium, is required by the human body to maintain a proper balance of the body. Packed with potassium, a banana can help in keeping your blood pressure levels in check after a salty meal, which can lower the risk of a stroke over time. This fruit is also rich in fibre and thus it can help in lowering the risk of heart diseases as well. It is yet another food rich in potassium that can counter the risk of high sodium. Not just that, it can change your taste quickly while keeping your gut healthy.'

It helps elevate your metabolism. Lifting causes an increase in the body???s resting metabolic rate ??? the rate at which it burns calories when you???re doing nothing???for hours after the workout which helps better fat burn. ???Lifting heavy weights makes the body more insulin sensitive (means that the body is better able to utilise sugars and carbohydrates for fuel),???

            explanation: 'The Rainy Season or more formally addressed as the monsoon season reaches India around the mid of June and stays until late august/early September. This season is primarily categorized by heavy incessant rainfall and humid conditions. Despite the prevalence of humidity, the cool showers bring much-needed respite from the scorching sun. As it rains, dry barren ponds and puddles are infused with life again. Rivers, yet again, flow at their full capacity and birds chirp all day long. Rains have, since times immemorial, been the favorite season of the land. It fuels flora and fauna enough to bear the brunt of dry barren summers and harsh freezing winters. Flowers bloom in all their full grandeur and crop roots soak up water during this time of the year.'

            explanation: 'Last year, in June I went for a visit to the hill stations named Gaddigaon and Zuluk, which is located in the East Sikkim. During June, it was utterly monsoon in East Sikkim. That was a fantastic feeling while experiencing the monsoon weather of the hill stations with my husband and that was a truly memorable trip for us. It was frequently raining throughout the day along with the cold and misty weather. Drenching in the rain waters in that cold weather was an inexpressible feeling. All the places were covered with clouds and mists, and there was the expansion of greenery all around the hills. In Gaddigaon, we stayed in a resort, from where we had a mesmerizing view of the range of mountains covered with clouds. In the resort, there was a small sitting area, beautifully decorated with the crafted wooden benches and a hut-like shade of straw and bamboo, where we used to sit for long and enjoy the pleasure of watching the mighty ranges of the Kanchenjunga Mountains covered with clouds. During the night it was really amazing to view the glittering lower valley of the entire East Sikkim. From Gaddigaon on the way to Zuluk, we encountered several mesmerizing waterfalls and scenic beauty of the mountains and clouds which left us spellbound. It was an entirely new experience the beauty monsoon in the hills. Though the old silk route to Zuluk was quite risky and accident-prone yet it was an outstanding feel of adventure while exploring the old silk route. We took some beautiful snaps of the beauty of monsoon in the hills and even daringly drenched in the chilled waters of the flowing waterfalls.'

            explanation: 'Monsoon in Himachal Pradesh is from July to September. The hills turn a lush green from all sides and Dalhousie gets most of the rain. However, although the rain turns the state mesmerising, there is an increased danger of landslides at this time so it???s always better to be forewarned. While not so great for adventure seekers as trekking and hiking are not allowed, Nature???s bounty is splendid during this season and with the light mist and beautiful atmosphere, you will have an unforgettable holiday if you visit Spiti, Kinnaur, Kasauli or McLeod Ganj. Most often, people avoid visiting Himachal Pradesh during the monsoons because of the unexpectedness of the rainfall and the possibility of landslides. But train and flight fares are relatively lower, and hotels offer off-season discounts. Remember to carry an umbrella and a few warm clothes as it can get quite cool when it rains.Himachal Pradesh in the monsoons is like tonic for the soul.If you???re the kind of person who doesn???t mind a few inconveniences such as getting wet in a sudden downpour, you will love visiting Himachal during the rains.The fine mist in the air, the sudden chill that makes you shiver, the brilliant verdant green of the tree covered mountains ??? all these will surely be imprinted on your mind for a long time.
